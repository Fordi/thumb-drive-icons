# Thumb drive icons

Icons for USB thumb drives so that they can be visually identified from their display in explorer.  Fork and push at your leisure; I'll add anything to this repo.

Example of use:

Create an autorun.inf, populated with:

	[autorun]
	icon=sd-cruzer-fit.ico
	
Then copy the appropriate file onto the root of the device.  For bonus points, make the files read-only and hidden.
